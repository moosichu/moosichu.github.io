Hi, I'm Tom! I enjoy programming games.

I'm currently a games-industry programmer at [Electric Square](https://www.electricsquare.com/) and a co-developer on [Crest](https://github.com/crest-ocean/crest).

I enjoy rock-climbing and am about 60% confident that there might be other things I've forgotten to mention that define me as a human being.

You can find out about my employment history and education on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moosichu/).
